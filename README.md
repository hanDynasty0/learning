# Learning

This is a repository for my programming notes as I learn and continue to learn.

## NumPy Notes
My notes from the first chapter of DataCamp's Intro to NumPy course. This was before I realized the rest of the course was behind a paywall. However, I did still learn the basics of NumPy arrays and also practiced using Git, since I am (was) writing this on my VSCode.
